# Housing-Price-Prediction

\\Task Approach//:

[Understanding the Problem and Making Assumptions]:

1) Problem Understanding: Review the dataset and its features to understand the context and objectives of predicting housing prices.
2) Assumptions: Make assumptions about the influential factors affecting house prices (e.g., area, location, number of rooms) based on initial data exploration.

[Data Cleaning and Exploration]:

1) Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
2) Feature Extraction/Engineering: Extract useful information from existing features and possibly create new features that might improve the predictive model.
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze relationships between features, their distributions, correlations with the target variable (price), and any outliers.

[Model Building and Evaluation]:

1) Model Selection: Choose appropriate regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, etc.) for predicting house prices.
2) Data Preparation: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3) Model Training: Train the selected models using the training data.
4) Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared score) on the test set.

[Validating Initial Assumptions]:

1) Comparing Assumptions: Check if the assumptions made initially about influential factors align with the actual findings and importance derived from the model.
2) Conclusions: Draw conclusions based on the observed results and whether the initial assumptions were supported or contradicted.

[Presentation and Documentation]:

1)Jupyter Notebook: Organize the analysis, code, visualizations, and conclusions in a Jupyter Notebook with proper markdown explanations.
2) GitHub Repository: Upload the Jupyter Notebook to a GitHub repository for review, along with any necessary files or datasets used.

\\Conclusion//:
The task involves comprehensive data analysis, cleaning, model building, and presentation to predict housing prices. Utilizing regression models, data cleaning techniques, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation will be essential to fulfill the requirements within the given deadline.
